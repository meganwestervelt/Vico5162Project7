        Little was known about the indigenous peoples living in Yasun√≠ National Park until the middle of the 20th century. When oil exploration and extraction began, it also initiated a fundamental change in the cultures that have traditionally coexisted with the natural resources of the region. During the transition from being nomadic warriors and hunters, the Waorani people living in the north of the region settled near the roads built by the oil company, quickly giving rise to the development of communities and large agricultural plots to support their new form of agrarian life. These warriors accepted an unspoken peace with their Kichwa neighbors. Now they do not fight among themselves but against the winds of change, trying to maintain their traditions and transmit the culture and way of life of their ancestors to the next generation; however, these ancient cultures are beginning to turn towards the influence of modern technology, foreign cultures, and lucrative capitalist opportunities.

        The Waorani consider themselves guardians of the jungle. They maintain their ancestral knowledge of the flora and fauna, keeping the secrets of the natural world protected. As outside influences increase their pressure on the growing indigenous communities, the Waorani struggle to keep up with the transition between worlds. Identity crisis is rampant, and social issues such as alcoholism and domesic violence have closely followed the increase in outside influence. By empowering the community members to tell their own stories, and therby engage a broader audience, these Amazonian protectors can begin to grow support for conservation of their land and culture.
